Breaking down the js:

API should:
-get random word of a specific length, exclude hyphenated word
--would be btr if I can get words by categories
-get word definition and display it along with the word once the player gets is wrong

user flow:
STAGE 1
-Extract random word and generate the an underlined element on the dom

-auto focus on the input box on load

-show hint button - can only be used once. Destroy click event and add disable class for the button after a single use.

-Set difficulty levels- change word length based on user request
--noob : 4-6
--amerture : 7-10
--novice : 11-14
--pro : 15-17

STAGE 2
-Set it up as an angular project.
